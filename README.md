# Predicting Restaurant Success: A Sentiment and Rating-Based Predictive Model

**Overview:**

This project analyzes online restaurant reviews and ratings to develop a predictive model for restaurant success.  The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing a restaurant's performance, such as sentiment expressed in reviews and overall rating scores. This information can be valuable for investors in making strategic decisions and for restaurant owners in improving their operational strategies. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment from reviews and statistical modeling to build a predictive model.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or spaCy - specify which is used)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key statistical analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics of the dataset and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the project will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `rating_vs_sentiment.png`) illustrating the relationships between sentiment, ratings, and other relevant factors.  The specific visualizations and output will depend on the implemented model and analysis.  The final model's predictive performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) will also be reported.


**Data:**

*(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.)*  For example:  "The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Data Source].  It contains [description of data fields] and has been preprocessed to handle missing values and clean text data.  The preprocessed data is included in the `data` folder."


**Future Work:**

*(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project.)* For example: "Future work could involve exploring more advanced NLP techniques, incorporating external data sources (e.g., location data, competitor analysis), and developing a more robust and interpretable predictive model."
